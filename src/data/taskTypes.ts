Your task is to review the **selected files** thoroughly.

**Please:**
1. **Assess quality & style** ‚Äì highlight violations of language or project conventions.
2. **Locate bugs / security risks** ‚Äì map each to file & line number if possible.
3. **Spot performance smells** ‚Äì add micro-benchmark suggestions where relevant.
4. **Judge maintainability** ‚Äì readability, modularity, naming, comments.
5. **Recommend actionable fixes** ‚Äì clear, specific, with code snippets.

**Output format (Markdown):**
- \`## Summary\`
- \`## Findings\` (*table: category | file:line | issue | recommendation*)
- \`## Suggested Patches\` (*concise diff blocks*)
- \`## Next Steps\`

Think step-by-step before writing. Do **not** change the code style guide unless requested.`,

**Process:**
1. Reproduce or reason about each suspected bug.
2. Explain root cause (in plain language).
3. Provide minimal yet complete patch (\`diff\` or full snippet).
4. Add regression test suggestion.
5. Propose prevention tactics (lint rule, CI check, pattern).

**Goals (in order):**
1. Remove duplication & dead code.
2. Rename for clarity (APIs, vars, files).
3. Extract smaller functions / classes for single responsibility.
4. Simplify complex logic (early-return, guard clauses).
5. Optimise critical hot-paths if profiling data suggests.

**Deliverables:**
- Explanation table: *before | after | why*.
- Refactored code snippets or diff.
- Risks & how to test migrations.

Keep public APIs stable unless explicitly told otherwise.`,

**Steps:**
1. Restate feature spec in your own words; list edge-cases.
2. Outline design (modules, data flow, DB changes).
3. Provide production-ready code (assume TypeScript unless files show otherwise).
4. Include input validation, error handling, logging hooks.

- Public API reference (params, returns, examples).
- Architecture & data flow section.
- Setup / installation / quick-start.
- Contribution & style guidelines.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify hotspots.
2. Recommend algorithmic improvements (and justify).
3. Optimise memory allocations / I/O patterns.
4. Propose caching or batching if safe.
5. Show how to benchmark the perfomance and what is the estimated improvement.
