# ⚡️🦀 PasteRust – Warp-Speed Context for Your LLM

An app to copy files (and your prompt of choice) into the clipboard for instant LLM context.

> “Re-indexed (cold startup) the entire TensorFlow monorepo (≈1.6 GB) in **6.7 seconds** on a humble i3‑10105F. No coffee breaks required.” — *PasteRust benchmark log*

## Why PasteRust Exists

I used [**kleneway/pastemax**](https://github.com/kleneway/pastemax) for months, but eventually got tired of Electron's sluggishness and waiting two minutes for the codebase to load. So I rebuilt the core in Rust + Tauri, cut out the bloat, and achieved native-level speed.

## 🛠️ From Click to Clipboard

1. **Select Folder** →
2. **Glance at Detected Files** →
3. **Tick the ones you need** →
4. *(Optional)* **Add an LLM prompt** →
5. **Copy XML** – you’re done.

```xml
<source_code_context>
  <user_prompt>Refactor for async/await best practices.</user_prompt>
  <files>
    <file path="src/lib.rs" name="lib.rs">
      // snip
    </file>
  </files>
</source_code_context>
```

## ✨ Tech Stack Faithful to Performance

| Layer           | Choice                    | Rationale                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**    | React + TypeScript + Vite | Hot‑reload that actually feels hot        |
| **Runtime**     | **Rust**                  | Safety at the speed of C                  |
| **Host**        | **Tauri**                 | Native WebView, 10× lighter than Electron |
| **FS Crawling** | `walkdir` crate           | Thread‑pooled I/O traversal               |
| **Clipboard**   | Tauri plugin              | Cross‑platform sanity                     |
